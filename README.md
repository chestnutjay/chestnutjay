- 🙋‍♀️ I'm Chathuri, a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida
- 😍 I'm interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and applications. 
- 🔭 My current research also deals heavily with identifying ambiguous cases in Natural Language Inference datasets and applications of Abstract Meaning Representations (AMR), which is a meaning representation formalism in NLP.
- 🪄 Data visualization is yet another topic that I'm drawn to, but I'm a newbie. When I have time, I like to create visualizations related to books 🔖 and music 🎧.
